# 👋 Hello, I'm Ibrahim

I am a **Graphics Programming** enthusiast, and a recent Master’s graduate specialising in **Computational & Software Techniques in Engineering (Computer & Machine Vision)**.

While my M.Sc. focused on Computer Vision, my core technical passion and professional focus is on **low-level rendering, high-performance GPU computing, and graphics API mastery.** I  aim to build systems that bridge the gap between complex visual data and fast, optimised, real-time rendering performance.

### Current Project: [DICOM Visualiser using WebGPU](https://github.com/ibby101/DICOM_Viewer)

### My Core Focus & Expertise:

I am driven by the challenge of designing performant rendering systems. I am actively exploring roles centred on Graphics Programming, Computer Vision Engineering and Machine Learning.

| Focus Area | Key Interests & Tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Modern Graphics APIs** | Learning **Vulkan** for high-performance, explicit rendering control, and developing projects using **WebGPU** for web visualisations. |
| **Visual Computing Systems** | Applying computational mathematics and image-processing techniques to tackle complex rendering and systems tasks. |

### Featured Projects:

My work emphasises practical application across both rendering and perception:

* **[3D-Visualiser-WebGPU](https://github.com/ibby101/3D-Visualiser-WebGPU)**
    My Master's thesis, dedicated to developing an **interactive 3D visualiser** powered entirely by the modern **WebGPU** Graphics API, demonstrating proficiency in web-based rendering pipelines.
* **[Vulkan-Learning](https://github.com/ibby101/Vulkan-Learning)**
    An ongoing, self-directed project focused on understanding the **Vulkan** graphics API, building foundational knowledge in memory management, command buffers, and descriptor sets.
* **[WAAM-ViD](https://github.com/IFRA-Cranfield/WAAM-ViD)**
    An **AI-powered vision system** for real-time dimensional analysis, leveraging advanced image processing and machine learning, which showcases a practical application of my M.Sc. expertise in a demanding industrial context.
* **[Zenith-Shift/shadows\_alchemy\_gamejam](https://github.com/Zenith-Shift/shadows_alchemy_gamejam)**
    Collaboration on a gamejam project, showcasing teamwork and rapid development skills within a real-time environment (using GDScript).
