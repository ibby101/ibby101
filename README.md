# 👋 Hello, I'm Ibrahim

I am a highly motivated **Graphics Programmer** and a recent Master’s graduate **specialising** in **Computational & Software Techniques in Engineering**.

While my M.Sc. focused on the advanced algorithms of Machine Perception (Computer Vision), my core technical passion and professional focus is on **low-level rendering, high-performance GPU computing, and graphics API mastery.** I architect systems that bridge the gap between complex visual data and fast, optimised, real-time rendering performance.

---

### My Core Focus & Expertise:

I am driven by the challenge of designing elegant, performant rendering systems. I am actively exploring roles centred on Graphics Programming and Real-Time Rendering.

| Focus Area | Key Interests & Tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Modern Graphics APIs** | Learning **Vulkan** for high-performance, explicit rendering control, and utilising **WebGPU** for cutting-edge web visualisation. |
| **GPU Computing** | Understanding parallelism, developing high-throughput compute shaders, and optimising pipeline architectures for modern GPU hardware. |
| **Visual Computing Systems** | Applying computational mathematics and image-processing techniques to tackle complex rendering and systems tasks. |

### Featured Projects:

My work emphasises practical application across both rendering and perception:

* **[3D-Visualiser-WebGPU](https://github.com/ibby101/3D-Visualiser-WebGPU)**
    My Master's thesis, dedicated to developing an **interactive 3D visualiser** powered entirely by the modern **WebGPU** API, demonstrating proficiency in web-based rendering pipelines.
* **[Vulkan-Learning](https://github.com/ibby101/Vulkan-Learning)**
    An ongoing, self-directed project focused on mastering the **Vulkan** graphics API, building foundational knowledge in memory management, command buffers, and descriptor sets.
* **[WAAM-ViD](https://github.com/IFRA-Cranfield/WAAM-ViD)** (As seen on my profile)
    An **AI-powered vision system** for real-time dimensional analysis, leveraging advanced image processing and machine learning—a practical application of my M.Sc. expertise in a demanding industrial context.
* **[Zenith-Shift/shadows\_alchemy\_gamejam](https://github.com/Zenith-Shift/shadows_alchemy_gamejam)**
    Collaboration on a gamejam project, showcasing teamwork and rapid development skills within a real-time environment (using GDScript).
